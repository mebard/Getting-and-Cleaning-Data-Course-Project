# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains one R script (run_analysis.R) and one data file (tidy_data.txt). 

The R script performs the following steps: 

- Downloads and unzips data to the working directory
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Outputs tidy data to the working directory in .txt format
